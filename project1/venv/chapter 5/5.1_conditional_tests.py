'''Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test
and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look
something like this:

car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')

print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

    • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each
    line evaluates to True or False.
    • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and
    another 5 tests evaluate to False.'''
