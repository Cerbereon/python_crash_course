'''Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in
your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and include
the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact about
that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something like
country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the
information you have stored about it.'''
