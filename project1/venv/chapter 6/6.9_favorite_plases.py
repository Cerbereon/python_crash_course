'''Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as
keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person.
To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of
their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s
name and their favorite places.'''
